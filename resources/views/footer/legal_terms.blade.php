							<li>It shall be your responsibility to make all necessary enquiries and take any action you consider necessary if you require insurance or require the service provider to be insured or to have insurance coverage that covers you in respect of the provision of their goods and services, prior to proceeding with any booking or services.

							<li>In relation to goods provided by a third party on redemption of a Insider Suite Pass, you recognise that the third party service provider is the supplier of the goods, and not Insider Suite.</li>
							<li>To the extent permitted by law (including the Australian Consumer Law), Insider Suite makes no warranty or representation regarding the standard of any goods or services to be supplied by the service provider.</li>

For example, they may depict only one of the various rooms, venues or locations at which the services are offered or provided;</li>
